USAGE:                - Select a customer in the Combobox
                      - Enter a Project ID
                      - Choose between Small and Big Project. For a small project
                        only one excel file will be created containing all documents
                        in one sheet. For a Big Project a project file structure will
                        be created with all of the selected documents
                      - The default value for Project Manager is taken from the
                        settings file. Other data in the documents is updated manually
                        after the file creation (using Word or Excel)
